      <h1>WE COME FROM <br/>HUNGRY BEGINNINGS</h1>
      <p>It started with Smashburger’s first restaurant opening at the Glendale Ave site in Denver, Colorado - home of the Rocky Mountains. It was 2007, and we were starving for a good burger. Oh sure, there were plenty of burgers out there, but they all tasted the same – rushed. Trading savoriness for speediness. Convenience over craftsmanship. A quick experience instead of a taste experience.   

          Using custom-forged burger smashers, our chefs set forth to craft the best burgers, fries, and shakes that quickly became a local sensation. Our burgers were so irresistible that we soon discovered we weren't the only ones craving a better burger – our ravenous fans couldn't get enough! And it wasn't just our burgers – even our sides were a hit. Our rosemary SmashFries® were so mouthwateringly delicious that we started receiving hate mail from customers who couldn't stop devouring them!
